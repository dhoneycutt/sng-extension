Their seclusion protected the denomination from the schisms of the early 20th century. Indeed, Baptists eschewed the kind of denominational controls exercised by many other churches, particularly regarding doctrine.

Baptists believed that they were called to convert the South, the South would lead the nation, and that the United States would lead the world.
