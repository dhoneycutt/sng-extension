For example, the first three fields of the R-type and I-type formats are the same size and have the same names; the fourth field in I-type is equal to the length of the last three fields of R-type. In case you were wondering, the formats are distinguished by the values in the first field: each format is assigned a distinct set of values in the first field (op) so that the hardware knows whether to treat the last half of the instruction as three fields (R-type) or as a single field (I-type).
