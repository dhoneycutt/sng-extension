Hence, the symbolic representation of the MIPS machine language is no longer limited by the hardware, but to whatever the creator of an assembler chooses to include (see Section 2.10). We stick close to the hardware to explain the architecture of the computer, noting when we use the enhanced language of the assembler that is not found in the processor.
