In addition to automatic variables that are local to procedures, programmers need space in memory for static variables and for dynamic data structures. Figure 2.1 7 shows the MIPS convention for allocation of memory. The stack starts in the high end of memory and grows down. The first part of the low end of memory is reserved, followed by the home of the MIPS machine code, traditionally called the text segment
