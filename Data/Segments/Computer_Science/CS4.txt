This first chapter lays the foundation for the rest of the book. It introduces the basic ideas and definitions, places the major components of software and hardware in perspective, and introduces integrated circuits, the technology that fuels the computer revolution. In this chapter, and later ones, you will likely see a lot of new words, or words that you may have heard, but are not sure what they mean.
