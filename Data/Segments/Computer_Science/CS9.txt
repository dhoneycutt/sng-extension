Note the similarity of the binary representations of the first and last instructions. The only difference is in the third bit from the left. Figure 2.7 summarizes the portions of MIPS assembly language described in this section. As we shall see in Chapters 5 and 6, the similarity of the binary representations of related instructions simplifies hardware design. These instructions are another example of regularity in the MIPS architecture.
