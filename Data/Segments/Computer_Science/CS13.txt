One place is South Korea. In 2002, 68% of South Korean households had broadband access, compared to 15% in the United States and 8% in Denmark. The main reason for the greater penetration is that 70% of households are in large cities and almost half are found in apartments. Hence, the Korean telecommunications industry could afford to quickly offer broadband to 90% of the households.
