After World War II Singapore resumed its busy trading focus, and in 1959 it became a self-governing 
Crown Colony with Lee Kuan Yew, a British-educated barrister, as its first prime minister. On September 2, 
1962, a referendum was held on whether to form a union with Malaya. Seventy-three percent of the electorate 
voted  in  favor. On September 16, 1963, Singapore became part of the new nation of Malaysia, a self-governing dominion of the British Commonwealth.
